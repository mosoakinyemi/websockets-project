# websockets-project

This project uses websockets to power a small realtime chatting/messaging app, using `node.js` for the server-side and `react` for the front end.

It's based off a tutorial form [Avanthika Meenakshi](https://blog.logrocket.com/websockets-tutorial-how-to-go-real-time-with-node-and-react-8e4693fbf843/)
